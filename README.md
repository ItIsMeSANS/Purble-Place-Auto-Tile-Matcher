Windows 7/8.1 support updates has ended. This inspiried me to create a automatic tile matcher or whatever its called.

__**To get started you will need to do:**__
1/ The get game itself
(If you are in win10/11 download it from microsoft store from here:)
[Link to download it](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/purble-place/9pk0nng0mv5n)

2/ Put the PurblePlace.exe.mui into C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Purble Place\en-US\
(I recommend you to create a backup) and replace it

3/ Run the script and follow it`s instructions and enjoy.

**Note: I may update this**
